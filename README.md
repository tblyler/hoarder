# Hoarder
Uploads .torrent files from a local "blackhole" to a remote (SSH) rtorrent watch folder. From there, rtorrent is polled over XMLRPC as to whether the torrent is completed. Finally, the files are downloaded over a multithreaded SSH connection and saved to the local machine. The blackhole is used as a queue and will have its .torrent files deleted.

# Configuration
## Example
```yaml
# The file mode to use for downloaded files and directories
file_download_filemode: 0777

# The correlation of .torrent file paths and where their contents should be downloaded to"

  /home/tblyler/torrent_files/movies: /home/tblyler/Downloads/movies
  /home/tblyler/torrent_files: /home/tblyler/Downloads

# The root path to temporarily download to and then move to the folder in the setting above. The destination path is created underneath the temp_download_path
temp_download_path: /home/tblyler/tempDownloads

# If defined, the finished .torrent files finished are moved to their respected path here. Otherwise, they are deleted.
watch_to_finish_path:
  /home/tblyler/torrent_files/tv: /home/tblyler/completed_torrent_files/tv
  /home/tblyler/torrent_files: /home/tblyler/completed_torrent_files
